Survey Website Overview:
This survey software will allow users to post their surveys online anonymously or to a certain people who have the links. This will give users control over their data and privacy. Our software data will aggregate data from the survey and display results in multiple formats such as charts. Users will be confident in the data they receive because our software will prevent users from voting more than once.
